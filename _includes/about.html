<h2 class="section-header">About us</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; line-height: 2em;">Born from a love of the outdoors and a passion for peaceful spaces, Western Carolina Waterscapes has been handcrafting custom ponds and landscapes since 1998. We’re a small, family-run team that works closely with each client—from initial design to final stone—bringing beauty, serenity, and function to every project. Whether it’s a stone being selected by hand from our private quarry to selecting the perfect food for your koi, you can rest assured knowing our work is rooted in quality craftsmanship and locally sourced materials. As authorized dealers of trusted pond supplies and koi food, we proudly deliver artistry that lasts.</p>
